## About Me
 Quality Assurance Professional with 5+ years of experience in manual testing, including test design, execution, defect tracking, regression, exploratory testing and documentation. I am experienced in collaborating closely with developers in Agile environments. Recently completed an intensive web development program, adding skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to my QA background.

Working closely on web application projects with developers has inspired my creative tendencies. For this reason, my long-term goal is to transition into technical development roles. I am eager to work as part of a strong team as a developer because I take pride in solving problems by creating products that provide an intuitive and appealing user experience. My experience in QA gives me a unique insight into the development process - I believe my quality-first mindset is a great asset to any team.

To aid in my career transition, I recently completed a Web Development course, in which I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I earned the AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate.
