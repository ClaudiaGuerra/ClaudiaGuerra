## About Me

I’m an Aspiring Web Developer transitioning from a QA background — and yes, I *actually enjoyed testing*!  
Working alongside developers sparked my interest in building beautiful, accessible, and intuitive interfaces. I'm also AWS Cloud Practitioner Certified. 

My journey into code has been fueled by:
- Curiosity to understand how things *work* under the hood  
- Pride in delivering quality experiences (QA mindset still kicking!)  
- The joy of turning ideas into working products  

I recently completed a Web Development course, learning:
- HTML5 · CSS3 · JavaScript · Git · GitHub · Responsive Design  
- Basic React (currently learning by building!)
